A vanilla JavaScript project working with the module pattern, the DOM and local storage with no frameworks, compiling or build tools. Add a desired food item with its calories, use the pencil edit button to update or delete an item. The clear all will erase the fields and reset the list. The module pattern in a sense was like working with a framework. Try it on: https://marccodez.github.io/Tracolorie-Module-Pattern-Project/
